# work-day-scheduler

## Description

In this project I created a calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm) by modifying starter code. 

The current date is displayed at the top of the calendar

You can see here the timeblocks from 9AM to 5PM and its also colour coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. You can enter an event when you click on the time block aswell.

When you click the save button for that time block then the event is saved in the local storage
